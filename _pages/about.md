I am a Lead Machine Learning Scientist at <a href="https://www.entos.ai/about">Entos, Inc</a>. I earned my Ph.D. degree in Chemistry from <a href="https://cce.caltech.edu/">Caltech CCE</a> with a minor in <a href="https://qse.caltech.edu/">Quantum Science and Engineering</a> (<a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/15077">Thesis</a>), where I was fortunately advised by <a href="http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/group.html">Prof. Anima Anandkumar</a> and <a href="https://millergroup.caltech.edu/Miller_Group/Home.html">Prof. Thomas Miller</a>.  My research centers around developing physics-driven geometric learning approaches to tackle complex problems in chemistry and chemical biology, with main interests in the study of electronic structure and dynamics out of equilibrium.

I earned my BSc from Peking University in 2019. As an undergraduate student I worked in the <a href="https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/gaoyq/">Gao Group</a> at <a href="https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/en/">PKU CCME</a>, where I studied the statistical mechanics of confined soft matters.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
