Iâ€™m a materials science researcher at <a href="https://www.eas.caltech.edu/">    Caltech EAS</a>, where I study fundamental thermal properties in materials at <a href="https://www.its.caltech.edu/~matsci/btfgrp/BTF_Group1.html">    Fultz Group</a>. My work sits at the intersection of theory, experiment, and computation using tools and techniques, including high-performance computing, machine learning and bayesian analyses applied to construction of lattice dynamics models and analysis of inelastic neutron scattering experiments for single crystals.

I eacned my BSc from Moscow Insitute of Physics and Technology in 2018 and continued with two Master Degrees from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and Skolokovo Institute of Science and Technology in 2020. During that time I worked with Alexey Yanilkin on Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials Benchmarking and in <a href="https://sites.skoltech.ru/multiscale">    Alexander Shapeev's Group</a> on Automatic Gaussian Process based approach to matials phase diagram construction.

During My BSs and MSc I had internships at <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=61024&pNid=1139">    Krasheninnikov Group</a> at <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=0">    HZDR</a> and <a href="https://photon-science.desy.de/research/research_teams/x_ray_crystallography_and_imaging/publications/index_eng.html">    Vartaniant Group</a> at <a href=    "https://www.desy.de/index_eng.html">    DESY</a>

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
