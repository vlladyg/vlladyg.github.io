abstract = {Predicting electronic energies, densities, and related chemical properties can facilitate the discovery of novel catalysts, medicines, and battery materials. However, existing machine learning techniques are challenged by the scarcity of training data when exploring unknown chemical spaces. We overcome this barrier by systematically incorporating knowledge of molecular electronic structure into deep learning. By developing a physics-inspired equivariant neural network, we introduce a method to learn molecular representations based on the electronic interactions among atomic orbitals. Our method, OrbNet-Equi, leverages efficient tight-binding simulations and learned mappings to recover high-fidelity physical quantities. OrbNet-Equi accurately models a wide spectrum of target properties while being several orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory. Despite only using training samples collected from readily available small-molecule libraries, OrbNet-Equi outperforms traditional semiempirical and machine learning–based methods on comprehensive downstream benchmarks that encompass diverse main-group chemical processes. Our method also describes interactions in challenging charge-transfer complexes and open-shell systems. We anticipate that the strategy presented here will help to expand opportunities for studies in chemistry and materials science, where the acquisition of experimental or reference training data is costly.},

  abstract={We refine the OrbNet model to accurately predict energy, forces, and other response properties for molecules using a graph neural-network architecture based on features from low-cost approximated quantum operators in the symmetry-adapted atomic orbital basis. The model is end-to-end differentiable due to the derivation of analytic gradients for all electronic structure terms, and is shown to be transferable across chemical space due to the use of domain-specific features. The learning efficiency is improved by incorporating physically motivated constraints on the electronic structure through multi-task learning. The model outperforms existing methods on energy prediction tasks for the QM9 dataset and for molecular geometry optimizations on conformer datasets, at a computational cost that is thousand-fold or more reduced compared to conventional quantum-chemistry calculations (such as density functional theory) that offer similar accuracy.},

  author={Qiao, Zhuoran and Zhao, Yuheng and Gao, Yi Qin},
  journal={The journal of physical chemistry letters},
  abstract={We confirmed that monolayer water confined by parallel graphene sheets spontaneously crystallizes from a structurally and dynamically heterogeneous liquid phase under moderate supercooling via direct molecular dynamics simulation. Square-lattice-like geometric order is observed at the early stage of nucleation and is preserved during the entire nucleus growth process. The diffusion coefficient and free energy profile in the cluster space extracted from a Bayesian trajectory analysis agree well with the classical nucleation theory (CNT) prediction and yield thermodynamic quantities exhibiting linear temperature dependence. The effectiveness of maximum cluster size as the descriptor of ice nucleation dynamics in the CNT framework can be attributed to the dynamical time scale decoupling and strong structural pattern dependence of density fluctuation in the liquid phase.},

  author={Cai, Xiaoxia and Xie, Wen Jun and Yang, Ying and Long, Zhuoran and Zhang, Jun and Qiao, Zhuoran and Yang, Lijiang and Gao, Yi Qin},
  journal={The Journal of chemical physics},
  abstract={We study, in this paper, the physical properties of water confined between two parallel graphene plates with different slit widths to understand the effects of confinement on the water structure and how bulk properties are reached as the water layer thickens. It was found that the microscopic structures of the interfacial liquid layer close to graphene vary with the slit width. Water tends to locate at the center of the six-membered ring of graphene planes to form triangular patterns, as found by others. The narrower the slit width is, the more pronounced this pattern is, except for the slit width of 9.5 Å, for which a well-defined two-layer structure of water forms. On the other hand, squared structures can be clearly seen in single snapshots at small (6.5 Å and 7.5 Å) but not large slit widths. Even at small slit widths, the square-like geometry is observed only when an average is taken for a short trajectory, and averaging over a long time yields a triangular pattern dictated by the graphene geometry. We estimate the length of time needed to observe two patterns, respectively. We also used the two-phase thermodynamic model to study the variation of entropy of confined water and found that at 8.5 Å, the entropy of confined water is larger than that of bulk water. The rotational entropy of confined water is higher than that of bulk water for all slit widths due to the reduction of the hydrogen bond in the confined space.},

  abstract={The ubiquitous existence of water confined in nano-capillaries is key to fundamental biological and technological applications. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyzed the hopping-like interlayer relocation dynamics of bilayer water confined between two parallel graphene sheets. In contrary to the common scheme that relocation is driven by density fluctuations, analysis of the transition path ensemble revealed that interlayer hopping is induced by local hydrogen bond configuration fluctuations coupled with activated consecutive transient angular reorientations. Our results consolidated the anisotropic nature of water relocation under strong ordering, which provided a mechanistic insight into the relaxation behavior at glass-forming water’s fragile-to-strong crossover.},
